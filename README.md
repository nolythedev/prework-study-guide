# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Welcome to the Study Guide Webpage, a project inspired by a passion for learning and a dedication to simplifying the study process. The Study Guide Webpage was created to address the common challenge of information overload and disorganisation that many students face, aiming to provide a user-friendly platform with thoughtfully curated study materials. Throughout the development process, insights were gained into effective code organisation, object-orientated programming, basic HTML structure and styling and version control.
